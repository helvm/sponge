<h1>Sponge - <small>a Scheme to Befunge compiler</small></h1>
<a href="index.html">Main</a>

<p>This page holds a <a href="sponge.lisp">quick and dirty compiler</a> for a
tiny subset of Scheme
into <a href="http://catseye.tc/projects/funge98/">Befunge 98</a>.
The compiler is written in (hopefully ANSI) Common Lisp.</p>

<h2>Supported dialect</h2>

The supported dialect of Scheme compiles the following special forms:

<ul>
<li><code>lambda</code> with proper lexical scope and closures.
It doesn't support variadic argument lists.
<li><code>if</code>
<li><code>set!</code>
<li><code>begin</code>
<li><code>let</code>
<li><code>letrec</code>
</ul>

The primitive operations start with an underscore and are <b>not</b>
first class procedures (which can be easily solved with an eta expansion,
e.g. <code>(lambda (x y) (_+ x y))</code>).
The following datatypes are supported:

<ul>
<li>Pairs: <code>_pair?</code> <code>_cons</code> <code>_car</code> <code>_cdr</code>
<li>Integers (with precision limited by the Befunge interpreter): <code>_integer?</code> <code>_+</code> <code>_-</code> <code>_*</code>
<code>_/</code> <code>_%</code> <code>_=</code>
<li>Booleans (noted <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>
instead of <code>#t</code> and <code>#f</code>):
<code>_boolean?</code> <code>_not</code>
<li>Closures: <code>_procedure?</code>
<li>Adding strings, characters and vectors should be straightforward.
Currently the Common Lisp code is quite a mess, though.
<li>The data is tagged, and every primitive operation checks the
types of its arguments and issues an error message if the types
aren't correct.
</ul>

The following are <b>misfeatures</b>:
<ul>
<li>No <code>call/cc</code>. However, since the compiler transforms the
code to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">CPS</a>,
it shouldn't be difficult to add.
<li>No variadic arguments.
<li>No garbage collection.
<li>No tail call optimization.
<li>No symbols or <code>quote</code> are supported.
<li>No <code>define</code>... and in general no every other form not mentioned before :)
<li>
</ul>

<h2>Compiling strategy</h2>

The compilation is done in lots of phases:

<ol>
<li>Desugar <code>let</code> and <code>letrec</code> into
<code>lambda</code> abstractions.
<li>Convert to CPS, so it isn't necessary to keep a stack
of return addresses (the code always calls its continuation,
jumping forward and never returning).
<li>Extract <code>lambda</code>s recursively, transforming them into toplevel definitions.
<li>Produce a matrix of Befunge code from Scheme code. (This is the "real" compilation).
<li>Print the matrix into a text file.
</ol>

Tricks used:

<ul>
<li>Befunge code is output in the following format:
<pre>
 main program      (row 0)
 memory ("heap")   (row 1)
 error handling    (row 2)
 routine handlers  (from row 3 on)
</pre>
<li>The code produced is almost Unefunge code. The main program is written in the
row 0.
<li>The row 1 is used as RAM, using the <code>g</code> (get)
and <code>p</code> (put) instructions. The first cells are
used as internal registers:
<ul>
<li>Register 0 holds a pointer for the next free space in the heap.
<li>Register 1 and 3 are used as auxiliary registers.
<li>Register 2 holds the pointer to the current activation record / stack frame.
</ul>
<li>Every object (integers, closures, etc.) is allocated
in the heap, and occupies at least one cell (the type tag).
The following cells hold the real values. Objects are manipulated
through their pointers.
<li>The row 2 holds a predefined error "handling" routine, which
prints an error message and exits.
<li>To simulate jumps or gotos, the "absolute delta" (<code>x</code> instruction)
is used. The compiler calculates the offset and hardcodes it.
<li>The n-th routine of the program has a routine handler in the (n+3)-th row.
When the n-th routine must be called, the caller jumps to the
(n+3)-th row. The routine handler then jumps to the appropiate column
of the 0-th row. This is done to avoid backpatching the offsets, since
the position of the routine handler can be known in advance.
</ul>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p><a href="sponge.lisp">Here</a> it is the compiler.
The Scheme code to be compiled is hardcoded in the source code, and
so is the output file. You might want to modify it to do something
fancier such as reading the code from a file, like normal people do.</p>

<p>The Befunge object code is reeeally big, but it seems to work in
at least some examples. Please be patient when you run the
result!</p>

<p>Now writing an Unlambda to Befunge compiler should be almost
a trivial task :)</p>

Happy hacking!
